<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the first post on <em>Jeu de la Hache</em>, a new blog I’m writing to record a
bunch of thoughts and experiences I’m having running my first proper game of
Dungeon Crawl Classics, an old-style dungeon crawing RPG by Goodman Games. I’ve
been running RPGs for 20 years now, but somehow have never had much opportunity
to dive into DCC outside of a few one-shots at local game stores. Recently,
however, I convinced my Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e group to try DCC, and so we’re
diving in head first (both into the game and into the blog). For this inaugural
post, I thought I’d write up some of my notes I’ve given to by D&amp;D players about
how to approach DCC if all you’ve ever played is 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
In a follow-up post, I’ll get into <em>why</em> I’m keen to run this group of people
through a small DCC campaign, and why I think dipping your toes into DCC could
be good for your own RPGs as well.</p>
<p>Before we get into the article, however, I just wanted to touch on what you can
expect from this blog if you want to stick around. Currently, the plan is to
write up my campaign prep notes for this DCC game here for everyone to enjoy
(and to keep me on the prep ball!). You can expect a bit of world-building, a
bit of monster-making, and a bunch of helpful tables for running a game set in
the forgotten depths of a fantasy world. Although meant for my own game, I am
hoping that the materials I create here will be useful for anyone running games
of DCC, so if that is something you are doing (or thinking of doing), I hope
you’ll stick around and join me on this adventure. Now, on to the article!</p>

<h1>How to play DCC (if all you know is D&amp;D)</h1>
<p>Thanks to an amazing resurgence of RPGs driven by a tremendously successful 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D), we’re seeing a huge influx of newcomers to the roleplaying hobby. Along with</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding dcc from 5e
<ul>
<li>you already know the rules
<ul>
<li>describe your characters actions and interactions in the world. When something arises with an uncertain and interesting outcome, roll a d20, add a relevant modifier, and try to beat a target difficulty set by the judge</li>
<li>if you have advantageous situations, add+2 (for small advantages) or roll a bigger die, opposite for disadvantages</li>
<li>literally everything else is specific and explicit and situational, so can be learned or dealt with as it comes up</li>
</ul></li>
<li>think about your character rather than your build
<ul>
<li>having only 7 classes and no feats or subclasses feels very limiting compared to 5e’s rich menu of choices</li>
<li>instead of thinking “this character is a warrior”, ask “how does this character make their way in the world?”</li>
<li>maybe your character is a tavern brawler who is excellent at fighting with whatever is at hand and always looks for ways to end a fight quick with dirty moves like eye gouges and gut shots</li>
<li>maybe your character is an expert fencer whose signature fighting style is famous for getting multiple foes off balance at once</li>
<li>maybe your character is a brutally strong outlander who can send foes flying with each axe blow</li>
<li>all of the above are “builds” you can make by making a warrior and thinking about what your specific character’s mighty deeds look like</li>
</ul></li>
<li>dms - get out of balance mindset and into story mindset</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
