<div id="welcome" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Recently, I’ve been running a game of Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for my regular RPG group, and I’ve been having a blast. Not
surprisingly, this enthusiasm has come with a desire to do a bit of <em>tweaking</em>
to the game, making it into what I call a “House Game”—that is, a set of rules
tailored to exactly how you like to run an RPG. I believe that most people who
run RPGs <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> have this to some degree. Sometimes, making a House Game involves
making a whole new RPG, but more often it’s just a few tweaks and houserules to
a beloved base system to make it your own.</p>
<p>This blog, <em>Jeu de la Hache</em> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, is
meant to record my process at turning DCC into a House Game for use at my
tables. I’m mostly writing this for myself, since giving air to a largely
internal design process has always helped me make better designs. However, I
also hope that this blog can serve as an introduction to DCC and an invitation
to other RPG players and designers to give this very excellent RPG a look.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-dcc" class="section level1">
<h1>Why DCC?</h1>
<p>Like virtually every other long-time RPG player out there, I’ve played <em>a lot</em>
of fantasy dungeon-crawling adventure. In part, because it’s what’s popular and
so it’s what’s easy to build a group around, but in part because it’s a fun
genre that I and many others enjoy. Like its more popular cousin D&amp;D, DCC is a
game of itinerant adventurers causing trouble, solving said trouble, and busting into
tombs and making off with the loot therein. This makes it useful as a House
Game, since it’s a popular and well-understood by most RPG players. In fact, the
core mechanics at play in DCC should be familiar to most:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Judge describes a scenario to the player(s).</li>
<li>The player describes how their character(s) act and interact in that
scenario.</li>
<li>If their character attempts an action that has an unknown and potentially
interesting outcome, the Judge will ask for a roll.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>This is usually a d20 roll.</li>
<li>Add a relevant ability score modifier, plus other situational bonuses or
penalites as applicable.</li>
<li>Higher rolls are usually better.</li>
<li>You succeed if you meet or beat a set difficulty number.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Judge narrates the outcome of your action (be it something simple like
“you climb the rope” or more mechanically complex like “you hit the monster;
roll weapon damage)”.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that sequence of events is familiar to you, you can probably sit down at a
game of DCC, pick up a character sheet, and jump into the game, with the extra
rules and changes explained to you as they become relevant.</p>
<p>So, if what I’m looking for in a House Game is a fantasy dungeon-romper, why go
with DCC in particular? This is a rich RPG space, filled with such behemoths as
D&amp;D 5e, Pathfinder, and the collected works of the OSR, so what makes DCC stand
out to me, and why do I think you should take a look at it too? There’s a few
things that I love about DCC, and the best way I know to illustrate them is to
show how they are similar to and different from these other games. Please note
that none of the following is meant to be a condemnation of any of these other
games: I’m a fan of all of them <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and they do what they do well.
DCC exists in the same neighborhood as these games, so it is useful to
understand it in relation to them, and in a certain sense I think it is a better
game for my purposes than any of the others, but that is not to say it’s a
better game <em>per se</em> or that you should feel bad if you like one of these other
games more.</p>
<div id="the-complex-dd-and-pathfinder" class="section level2">
<h2>The Complex: D&amp;D and Pathfinder</h2>
<p>One of the great strengths of D&amp;D 5e and Pathfinder is the mechanical breadth of
character options. When you make a Fighter, it feels really different from
making a Wizard or a Rogue. Every level, you get new powers and abilities that
say “This is my character, this is what they can do, this is what makes them
unique at the table and the world.” To me, a major part of the fun in an RPG
comes from making meaningful choices, and having the class you pick to play be
meaningfully distinct from the other classes you could have picked is a major
example of this.</p>
<p>Although DCC only has seven classes, they are each designed to play very
differently from each other, perhaps even moreso than D&amp;D. Warriors aren’t just
“good at fighting;” a DCC Warrior gets an ability called a Mighty Deed of Arms
that means 1/3 of the time they hit something (at first level), they can do a
near-supernatural feat of prowess in addition to the attack, from a disarm or
grapple to a skull-crushing blow that temporarily blinds their opponent or an
attack that hews their foe in twain and sends their corpse crashing into their
comrades, knocking them over. All of the DCC classes have something like
this—a class-specific ability that lets them do something no-one else can.</p>
<p>Similarly, the magic system in DCC is mechanically rich, with each spell feeling
like a unique piece of magic. Like D&amp;D, a Wizard (or Cleric, though they are a
bit different) knows a specific number of spells taken from a rich list provided
by the game rules. However, Wizards are not limited in how many times they may
attempt a spell. Instead, they roll a spell check (much like how a Warrior must
roll an attack roll to hit). The effect of the spell check determines not only
whether the spell succeeds or not, but also the spell’s effects, with higher
rolls giving more powerful versions of the spell.</p>
<p>All this is to say that DCC has a mechanical richness/complexity closer to
D&amp;D/Pathfinder than it does to the OSR games, which aligns with my and my
table’s desires in an RPG. However, it has a sharp difference between these
other complex games in terms of the philosophy of character design. DCC leans
heavily on randomness in its character creation: in fact, in the base rules, you
“make a character” by rolling up four peasants completely randomly and then
picking a class for any that survive their first adventure.</p>
<p>This heavy reliance on randomness means it is almost impossible to have a
specific “build” for a character. This has been my greatest complaint with D&amp;D
5e: the combat focus and explosion of character options means there is an
increasing tendency to make characters completely designed around a specific set
of rules interactions, which feels like a competition between players trying to
make characters that are absurdly good at shutting down specific kinds of
challenges and Judges that need to stay on top of all the rules interactions to
make appropriate challenges for them. DCC does away with this problem completely
by having many details of your character left up to chance, and then invites you
to “quest for it” if you want to make specific changes or gain new powers,
rather than selecting them from a list at level-up.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-simple-osr" class="section level2">
<h2>The Simple: OSR</h2>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum lie the OSR (Old-School Revival/Renaissance)
games. These are games that try to get back to the roots of the RPG hobby,
emulating or re-organizing the original D&amp;D rules as designed by Gygax and
Arneson. Most of what DCC does differently from these games is already covered
in the above (i.e. it is more mechanically complex and has more richness in how
classes and spells differ from each other). Here, I will instead focus on the
similarities between DCC and the OSR, which helps to enrich the DCC experience
overall.</p>
<p>The whole motivation behind DCC is to get back to “Appendix N” <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> fantasy gaming, and so in that sense,
DCC <em>is</em> part of the OSR. Its mechanics look quite different from most other
OSR games, and so people think of it as OSR-adjacent rather than a “true OSR”
game, but in terms of philosophy, this game is 100% meant to evoke feelings of
the original RPGs from the 70s. Indeed, DCC’s reliance on very weird dice (the
D7 is a favourite of mine) is an intentional decision to evoke the feeling of
the first time you picked up a D20 and asked what on earth it was.</p>
<p>A big part of the OSR games is a sort of DIY spirit. Rather than try to have a
specific rule defined for every situation a character may encouter, OSR games
empower Judges to make up an on-the-fly ruling based on common sense and table
buy-in. This “OSR spirit” is alive and well in DCC. I mentioned this briefly
above, but a major DCC principle is the “quest for it” mentality. If a player
wants a specific character ability or magic item, they are encouraged to spend
some time in-game researching and then questing for it. For example, base DCC
doesn’t have a barbarian class, and there are no rules for Warriors gaining
rage-based combat abilities. If a player wanted to play such a berserker
character, the DCC solution would be to seek out the lost caste of rage-trance
warriors buried beneath the Ironfang mountains and convince them to share their
techniques. In a more general sense, DCC’s OSR philosophy strongly encourages
character development and mechanical advancement to happen at the table, in the
game, as part of the story.</p>
<p>The other good OSR-like aspect of DCC comes in the combat rules. Specifically,
most characters (including monsters and NPCs) have <em>very few</em> hitpoints compared
to D&amp;D 5e. This ensures that combat is fast and brutal, and means that a single
solid roll from an attacker can drop almost any foe, making fights uncertain and
tense. DCC has a reputation as a very lethal game, and honestly, this is talked
up a little bit more than is true; after your peasants become true characters,
they are hardy enough for a few tumbles in the adventure. However, unlike our
D&amp;D days, my DCC table has seen a character <em>near death</em> almost every fight,
meaning fights are not entered lightly and often more memorable when they do
happen.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>To summarize, I’m focusing my homebrewing efforts on DCC because it is a fantasy
dungeon crawler that occupies a sweet spot for me in terms of having enough
mechanical complexity to make character-based choices feel meaningful and
distinct, without so much that a large part of the game becomes about making
optimized character builds away from the table. Instead, the focus is on
developing interesting characters based on their adventures and mishaps at the
table. It’s fun, it’s fast, and it’s straightforward without being same-y after
a few levels. Combat is exciting and lethal, magic is chaotic and <em>magical</em>, but
overall the rules are familiar enough that it’s a pretty easy pitch to convince
people who have only ever played a single RPG to learn them.</p>
<p>I focused on <em>character rules</em> in this exploration of DCC, in part because I’ve
found that the rules governing characters are the most important for setting the
tone of a game, and in part because DCC is pretty sparse on rules for
Judges. This is going to be a major focus for some of the homebrewing that is
coming in the next few posts: setting up some rule systems to help make other,
non-character based parts of the game feel more mechanically driven and less
Judge fiat-based. But first, a look at DCC and DCC Lankhmar, and how merging the
two will make the basis for this House Game.</p>
