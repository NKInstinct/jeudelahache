<div id="whats-a-lankhmar" class="section level1">
<h1>What’s a Lankhmar?</h1>
<p>DCC Lankhmar is a boxed set of DCC rules and adventures set in the world of
Nehwon, from Fritz Lieber’s Fafhard and the Grey Mouser stories <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Lankhmar, the largest city in Nehwon,
is a foetid pit of skulduggery and an excellent location for the kinds of
morally grey stories DCC likes to tell. As interesting as the setting is,
however, it’s not what I’m looking for in a House Game—not that I don’t like
Lankhmar, I’m just looking for something a little more generic so that I can
more readily adapt a given game to the players.</p>
<p>Rules-wise, DCC Lankhmar introduces a couple of very interesting new mechanics
to a DCC game. Goodman Games has said that there will never be a “2nd edition”
of DCC that invalidates the previous editions, but the general sentiment around
Lankhmar is that the new rules here are the next closest thing. There are three
rules from Lankhmar that I will be lifting into my House Game version of DCC, as
detailed below.</p>
<div id="no-funnel" class="section level2">
<h2>No Funnel</h2>
<p>Adventurers in Lankhmar are already heroes, and so newly made characters start
at level 1 with a class already, and a couple changes to how stats are rolled to
“simulate” the attrition of bad characters in the funnel. As fun as a level 0
funnel is to run, it’s a bit more work to set up for each new group and in my
experience, makes selling the idea of DCC in general a bit more difficult, so
I’m going with the Lankhmar version of character creation.</p>
</div>
<div id="benesons-and-dooms" class="section level2">
<h2>Benesons and Dooms</h2>
<p>Lankhmar characters each get a unique beneson (a random special power based on
where they are from) and doom (similar, but a drawback), and then an option to
buy a second one by spending luck based on how good it is. This has been very
well-received in my group, and helps to bring back a little bit of the “build a
character concept” feeling that people used to D&amp;D miss when they come to DCC,
without pitching the game into build-land.</p>
</div>
<div id="fleeting-luck" class="section level2">
<h2>Fleeting Luck</h2>
<p>In addition to their Luck stat, which works as normal, Lankhmar heroes have a
Fleeting Luck resource that lets them be a little faster and looser with
spending luck to improve results in their favour. My games are all about finding
ways to encourage players to take creative control of the narrative, so an extra
way for them to make a situation go in a way they are excited about is good in
my books.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="tweaks-to-base-dcc" class="section level1">
<h1>Tweaks to base DCC</h1>
<p>Having taken those three rules from Lankhmar, I’m going to also make a couple of
changes to the base DCC classes to better fit my vision for a House Game. In
particular, I’m going to remove the race-as-class element of the DCC classes by
re-flavouring them into more generic character archetypes. Race-as-class helps
to anchor DCC in Appendix N-style fantasy, but it isn’t what I’m going for with
my game.</p>
<div id="dwarf-becomes-marauder" class="section level2">
<h2>Dwarf becomes Marauder</h2>
<p>The DCC Dwarf is basically a Warrior with some slightly tuned-down abilities
(fewer HP, critical tables don’t go as high) in exchange for a unique
shield-bash attack and a few dwarf-y abilities. To me, this conjures up an image
of a somewhat gruff highwayman-type character, specializing sword-and-board
fighting and obtaining money. The specific reflavourings and changes I will make
are:</p>
<p><strong>Infravision</strong> becomes <strong>Night-Eye</strong>: <em>Your years of nighttime raids and life
in the wild have left you accustomed to operating in the dark. You can “see” in
extremely low-light environments out to 60’, though you can’t make out fine
details of things you are seeing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Slow</strong> gets removed. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Underground Training</strong> becomes <strong>Knave-sense</strong>: <em>You’ve seen every dirty trick
in the book and know how to avoid them. Add your class level to any checks to
detect traps or tricks in your surrounding environment. Additionally, you have
an excellent sense of where loot might be found, and can sense the direction of
large piles of gold and gems within 100’. Studying a mark or a location for a
moment can let you detect even a single coin.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="elf-becomes-spellsword" class="section level2">
<h2>Elf becomes Spellsword</h2>
<p>The DCC Elf is already a cross between a Wizard and a Warrior, so most class
features only need a slight tweak:</p>
<p><strong>Magic</strong>: <em>The spellsword must perfect both martial and magical training; the
indwelling of these two opposed forces cause a number of strange effects to
manifest in their being.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The close proximity of magic and metal in a spellsword’s life sets up an
antipathic effect, where prolonged contact with iron and other base metals
causes a painful burning sensation. The Spellsword cannot wear armour or wield
weapons made of metals except for mithril. Because of this, spellswords may
start the game with a mithril weapon and set of armour bought for the same price
as a normal variant.</li>
<li>The spellsword has learned to channel small amounts of arcane power to enhance
their vigilance. The spellsword can see in the dark out to 60’, gains a +4 bonus
to detect secret doors, and cannot be magically paralyzed or forced to sleep</li>
<li>Learning both arms and magic is taxing, and the spellsword enlists help
whenever possible. They receive <em>patron bond</em> and <em>invoke patron</em> spells at 1st
level automatically.</li>
<li>Finally, the spellsword’s magical training tends to focus more on mastering a
single “signature” spell than the more well-rounded Wizard. The spellsword may
choose to apply their luck bonus at 1st level to a single spell’s spellcheck.
This bonus does not change, even if the spellsword’s luck modifier changes
later.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="halfling-becomes-noble" class="section level2">
<h2>Halfling becomes Noble</h2>
<p>This might be the biggest stretch of the three, but since the halfling is
largely about luck and sharing luck around the team, the class speaks to me of a
team coordinator. Most of the rules are unchanged, just the reasons behind them
become a bit different:</p>
<p><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong>: <em>You are trained in the art of fencing, and can fight
comfortably with a weapon in either hand. This is fashionably a rapier and main
gauche, but you are not limited to this selection.</em></p>
<p><strong>Small Size</strong> is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Slow</strong> is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Infravision</strong> is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Stealth</strong>: <em>A combination of practice at intrigue and a keen desire to save
your own skin have made you particularly good at vanishing when needed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Good Luck Charm</strong> becomes <strong>Blue-Blooded</strong>: <em>Fortune has always smiled on your
family, and luck seems always on your side. This can even extend to your
comrades, who can benefit from your luck if you are able to see them and give a
bit of encouragement, insight, or warning.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="what-about-races" class="section level2">
<h2>What about races</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve removed race-as-class, we can turn to Benesons and Dooms to put
races back in the game. Race as a concept in RPGs is somewhat problematic; the
better word would probably be species, but that gives a more modern/sci-fi vibe
so feels out of place in a fantasy game. Lankhmar avoids this problem by only
having humans, and then providing different backgrounds through the different
benesons that they can possess.</p>
<p>Our game will do something similar: the Lankhmar-specific names of the
backgrounds will be changed to something more generic, and will also make space
for players to play a specific fantasy species if they want but not be limited
to it. The other nice thing about benesons rather than racial abilities from
other games is that there are 20 to chose from for each background and you
choose them randomly. So you don’t have the problem where suddenly all elves are
good at longbows and forestry. Instead, there’s a chance that if you are playing
an elf, they might have notable longbow or forestry skills, but probably not
both, and they’re just as likely to be noteworthy for a specific political
connection. This goes a long way to make “elf” feel more like a culture and less
like a stereotype.</p>
<div id="backgroundsheritages" class="section level3">
<h3>Backgrounds/Heritages</h3>
<p><strong>Lankhmar</strong> becomes <strong>Metropolis (human)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Land of the Eight Cities</strong> becomes <strong>Woodland Realm (Elf)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cold Waste</strong> becomes <strong>Mountains (Dwarf)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eastern Lands</strong> becomes <strong>Estates (Halfling)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mingol Steppes</strong> becomes <strong>Badlands (Orc)</strong></p>
<p>Under this new conception of backgrounds, the species indicated in parantheses
are just there to help ground the choice in common parlance. If a player wants
to play a “typical” orc, they could pick Badlands and roll, but there’s nothing
saying they couldn’t also decide to play a dwarf who was raised in the badlands
and who learned to ride a mule to great effect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="avoiding-non-heroes" class="section level2">
<h2>Avoiding non-heroes</h2>
<p>The final new rule I’m going to add to character creation is a reroll qualifier
like what was present in 3rd edition D&amp;D. Players will roll their stats as
normal for a Lankhmar character, and then when they are done, if the sum of
their modifiers is zero or less, they may erase all six of their attributes and
roll them again. While playing a character with terrible stats could be a fun
challenge for some players (and indeed, the choice to reroll is always a
choice), this rule provides an unbiased way to rescue a player from a character
they aren’t ever going to be excited about.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Combining in these new rules introduced in Lankhmar helps to broaden the
character choices made a bit during character creation, which should help
newcomers to DCC feel a bit more in control of what their experience will be
like. This also has the benefit of addressing race/heritage in fantasy in a way
that avoids blanket stereotypes (no more “All orcs are strong and dumb, all
gnomes learn to speak with animals”) but also avoids going too far the other way
and pretending that all heritages are identical.</p>
