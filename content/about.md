My name is Andrew, an immunologist by day and an RPG enthusiast by night. I've
been running RPGs for about 20 years now, and knew I had something special in my
hands when I first flipped through DCC a couple years ago. I'm writing this blog
to record my work on tweaking DCC into the home system that I'll use at most
fantasy RPG tables going forward. I'm currently living in Boston, MA with my
wife (who plays a _shopkeeper_, not a thief, thank you very much!) and two cats,
and can be found frequenting Pandemonium Books and Games in Cambridge (or will
be, you know, once this whole pandemic thing gets sorted).

I'm writing this website using the very excellent blogdown R package by Yihui
Xie and company. This lets me serve a simple blog without ads or tracking or
anything like that, a place where I can send my thoughts out to the internet and
you can read them if you want and nothing more. Who knows, maybe I'll start a
patreon if this blows up, but the goal isn't to turn RPGs into my job. There's
no space for comments on this blog because I don't know how to do that yet, but
you can find me on twitter if you have a thought to share.

Happy gaming!

-Andrew
